Data Analysis and Predictive Model for High-Traffic Generaring Recipes

# Predicting Popular Recipes and High Website Traffic on Tasty Bytes

Our data science team at Tasty Recipe has been tasked with developing a model that accurately predicts which recipes will be popular 80% of the time, and minimizing the occurrence of showcasing unpopular recipes on Tasty Bytes homepage.

More specifically, the challenge is divided into two objectives:
- Predict which recipes displayed on the website homepage will lead to high traffic
- Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time

The aim of the following project is to leverage the power of machine learning to accurately predict high traffic on our website. We will begin by conducting quality control and validation on the available historical data, followed by exploratory data analysis to gain deeper insights into the data. To handle any missing data, we will perform thorough data pre-processing and cleaning to ensure the reliability and suitability of the data for analysis.

Our next step will be to establish a baseline model using a simple algorithm and evaluate its performance compared to random guessing. Then, we will develop a more advanced model to improve the prediction accuracy. We will define clear business metrics to evaluate the performance of our models, and present our findings and conclusions with clear recommendations and next steps for Tasty Bytes data science team to follow.
